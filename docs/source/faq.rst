Why are you doing this?
    This project started when ads on Read the Docs were added to the common
    blocking list `EasyList`_. Read the Docs is an open source project and
    service that builds documentation for other open source projects. It is 
    primarily funded through advertising.
    The addition to the EasyList made a significant
    impact on the funding for Read the Docs. After talking with other open
    source maintainers, this problem is not unique to Read the Docs.

My adblocker allows acceptable ads. Do I still need this?
    Read the Docs identified multiple projects where ads were blocked and those
    projects lacked the time and resources to work with the
    `AcceptableAds group`_ or educate users about the impact of adblocking on
    their funding. These whitelists are specifically to help these projects.
    These whitelists are not a strict subset of the acceptable ads list.

    Furthermore, some users don't want to allow acceptable ads while they are
    willing to tolerate ads to benefit the developer community.

I run an open source project. How do I get on the whitelist?
    Please see the page on :doc:`getting included <inclusion>`.

How do I report an ad that shouldn't be whitelisted?
    Please open an `issue on GitHub`_.

All ads are bad. Don't you think so?
    The advertising industry gets a bad rap. Much of it is deserved. There have
    been trends toward bigger, more intrusive ads and closer tracking of users.
    Not all advertising is this way. Read the Docs' `ethical advertising`_ is a
    good counter-example. Some open source projects would not exist without
    sources of funding.

I do not click on ads so why should I bother?
    Not all ads are priced per click.
