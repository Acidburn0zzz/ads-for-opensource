Installing Adblock Filter Lists
===============================

Adblock lists, whether filters that block additional items or allow
exceptions like the ones here, can be installed on every major
adblocker. Here are the installation steps on the three biggest adblockers.

The easiest way to install these lists on AdblockPlus is to use AdblockPlus'
URL listener for subscribing to new lists:

* Click this link for the `Open Source Ads List`_
  and confirm by hitting the "Yes, use this filter list" button
* Or click this link for the `Read the Docs Ads List`_
  (a subset of the first list that only allows ads on Read the Docs)
  and confirm by hitting the "Yes, use this filter list" button

.. _Open Source Ads List: abp:subscribe?location=https://ads-for-open-source.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/lists/opensource-ads.txt&title=Open%20Source%20Ads%20Exceptions
.. _Read the Docs Ads List: abp:subscribe?location=https://ads-for-open-source.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/lists/readthedocs-ads.txt&title=Read%20the%20Docs%20Ads%20Exceptions

Alternatively, adding filter lists on AdblockPlus can be done in just a few steps:

* Click on the ABP extension icon on your browser and choose "Options".
* Under the "advanced" tab, click the
  "Add a new filter list"
* Enter the URL of the list you want to subscribe to
  (`Open Source Ads`_, `Read the Docs Ads`_), give it a name, and
  lastly click the "Add a filter list" button.
