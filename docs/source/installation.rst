Installing Adblock Filter Lists
===============================

Adblock lists, whether filters that block additional items or whitelist
exceptions like the ones here, can be installed on every major
adblocker. Here are the installation steps on the three biggest adblockers.

The easiest way to install these lists on AdblockPlus is to use AdblockPlus'
URL listener for subscribing to new lists:

* Click this link for the `Open Source Ads Whitelist`_
  and confirm by hitting the "Add" button
* Or click this link for the `Read the Docs Ads Whitelist`_
  (a subset of the first list that only whitelists Read the Docs)
  and confirm by hitting the "Add" button

.. _Open Source Ads Whitelist: abp:subscribe?location=https://ads-for-open-source.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/lists/opensource-ads.txt&title=Open%20Source%20Ads%20Whitelist
.. _Read the Docs Ads Whitelist: abp:subscribe?location=https://ads-for-open-source.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/lists/readthedocs-ads.txt&title=Read%20the%20Docs%20Ads%20Whitelist

Alternatively, adding filter lists on AdblockPlus can be done in just a few steps:

* Click on the ABP extension icon on your browser.
* Under the "filter lists" tab, in the dropdown titled
  "Please choose a filter subscription from the list"
  choose "Add a different subscription".
* Enter the URL of the list you want to subscribe to
  (`Open Source Ads`_, `Read the Docs Ads`_), give it a name, and
  lastly click the "Add" button.
