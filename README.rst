Advertising for Open Source Exception Lists
===========================================

This repository contains filter lists compatible with many ad blockers such
as Adblock, AdblockPlus, and uBlock Origin that whitelists advertising that
directly benefits open source software.

Many open source projects depend on advertising to fund their development
and operations.

There are two whitelists:

Open Source Ads Whitelist (`view list <https://ads-for-opensource.readthedocs.io/_static/lists/opensource-ads.txt>`_, `add to AdblockPlus <abp:subscribe?location=https://ads-for-opensource.readthedocs.io/_static/lists/readthedocs-ads.txt&title=Open%20Source%20Ads%20Whitelist>`_)
    This list whitelists advertising that directly benefits open source
    projects by paying for development, paying for operations, or providing
    direct funding. You can `read more`_ for details on the criteria for
    inclusion or to get your project included.

Read the Docs Ads Whitelist (`view list <https://ads-for-opensource.readthedocs.io/_static/lists/readthedocs-ads.txt>`_, `add to AdblockPlus <abp:subscribe?location=https://ads-for-opensource.readthedocs.io/_static/lists/readthedocs-ads.txt&title=Read%20the%20Docs%20Ads%20Whitelist>`_)
    This list whitelists advertising on Read the Docs. Read the Docs is an
    ad-supported website that builds documentation for tens of thousands of
    open source projects. Advertising on Read the Docs complies with their
    policy of `ethical advertising`_ which takes privacy seriously. This list
    is a strict subset of the Open Source Ads Whitelist.
